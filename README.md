# learningPython

A versioned record of my Python programming journey

This repository serves as a professional log of all the python programs I develop as I progress from foundational concepts to more advanced topics. Each directory corresponds to a specific lesson or concept with source code acting as an organized view of my growth as a python programmer.

2) Study Plan
   
    I follow a disciplined, chapter-wise approach following classic texts:
    
    - Primary Text:  
      "Python Crash Course"  by Eric Matthes  
    - Reference:  
      "Automate the boring stuff" by Al Sweigart (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
    
    For each chapter (e.g. Chapter 1):  
    1. Read the chapter in Python Crash Ourse.  
    2. Reproduce all code examples in `01_chapter-1/examples/`.  
    3. Solve relevant practice questions from Python Crash Course and Automate Boring Stuff and write codes for practice exercises of both bools in `01_chapter-1/exercises/`.
  
    I will also be practicing problems from leetcode and other such sites with an aim of one problem per day.
